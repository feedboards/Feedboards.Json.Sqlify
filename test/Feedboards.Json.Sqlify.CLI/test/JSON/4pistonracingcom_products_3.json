This engine is a \"no-compromises\" approach using the highest quality components available, starting with a rigid 4P ductile iron sleeve and our durable 340 gram aluminum rod. This is connected to a strutted ultra lightweight 15:1+ compression 260 gram anodized piston with tool steel wrist pin. The piston and ring package are specifically designed for this engine to provide superior ring seal for maximum compression and lowest friction possible. Air and fuel move through this engine via our latest \"REAPER\" CNC Cylinder Head using the new 4P Race casting and exclusive billet camshaft. We are on the cutting edge of 4 valve cylinder head technology and you will not find similar performance in any other cylinder head. Our unique design allows these engines to peak and carry hundreds of RPM beyond the competition, all while retaining the bottom end punch for excellent acceleration through the early part of the track. The super alloy valves are controlled by the infamous 4P Pro Stock valve spring...often copied by others however not duplicated in wire purity.\u00a0 This spring produces high rpm power that is lost in other valve springs.\u00a0 With 4P\u00a0you aren't just investing in a top competitor, you are investing in a customer support system and an engine program that you can depend on\u00a0for race wins.\u00a0\u00a0\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e4P\u00a0rigid ductile iron sleeve Honda K20 or K24 engine block 99mm stroke x 90mm bore\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e4P GRP aluminum 340 gram pro stock connecting rod\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e4P Wiseco strutted box forge ultra lightweight piston, 90mm, 15:1 compression\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eACL race bearings, ARP fasteners, exclusive 4P spec head gasket for better seal\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e4P\u00a0Reaper\u00a0CNC race cylinder head, 4P custom valves, 4P PSI Pro Stock valve springs, Ferrea locks\u00a0\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e4P Exclusive Billet Camshaft\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e4P Ported oil pump and 9 qt 4P Oil pan Standard\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e4P Extreme Race Timing Chain Guides and Treated Chain\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eComplete engine valve cover to oil pan\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMeticulously assembled and documented\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e9.2 and 147 mph proven on M1 in All Motor, in multiple cars by multiple teams\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThis 2.5L will outperform 2.7L engines from other builders.\u00a0 Read that again.\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003c\/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: medium;\"\u003eRecommended Use\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/strong\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: small;\"\u003eDrag Race\u003cbr\u003e\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDedicated Grudge Race \/ Street Race\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: small;\"\u003eM1 or Pure Methanol Race fuel required\u003cbr\u003e\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: small;\"\u003e4P Spec Kinsler ITB, 4P Carbon Airbox and Myers 4P Spec Header recommended for optimal results\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003c\/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: small; color: #ff2a00;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLIMITED PRODUCTION:\u00a0 Production of these engines will be limited to 10 for 2024.\u00a0 A 50% deposit gets you a spot in line for production and reserves your name as 1 of the 10.\u00a0 Get your deposit in so that you are prepared for the 2024\/2025 Season.\u003c\/strong\u003e\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u00a0\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmail \u003ca title=\"Email 4Piston\" href=\"mailto:%20luke@team4piston.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eLuke@team4piston.com\u003c\/a\u003e for a shipping quote and lead time.\u00a0 We ship worldwide.

The pump has been tested well over 11,000 rpm with great success. We start with a brand new OEM oil pump from Honda, disassemble, port and smooth oil passages to increase flow, and modify the outside housing so that it can be used on all K24 and K20 engines (including the K20Z3). The pumps are then cleaned, oiled, reassembled and repackaged.
