Keep your car 100% direct injection only!  This pump is a bolt-on and will take around 20 minutes to install.  With stock fuel injectors we were able to achieve over 480whp with the use of this pump.  Pair it with our high flow fuel injectors for up to 600whp with DI only.  Not only does this open the door to higher horsepower levels, it allows you to do it safely with acceptable air fuel ratios.  There have been some 450hp dyno charts posted while leaning hard on the OEM fuel system with race gas and very lean air fuel ratios.  This fuel system allows you to keep your air fuel ratios safe....its not just for glory pulls on the dyno you can actually race your car hard on this system with room to spare.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOur development with this pump has been easily accomplished with a Motec ECU and Engineering Support from XDI.  Right now you are NOT able to run this fuel pump with ANY OEM ECU tuning software solution.  They lack the capability to alter a few critical components, that are easily controlled with Motec or other motorsports grade ECU.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThese are available for immediate shipment in most cases, or can take up to a week to ship.

Full-Race\u2019s legendary design and engineering quality applied to the FK8 chassis results in a turbo kit that drives and spools like stock at low rpm and low load \u2013 but boosts unmistakably like a Turbo Honda at WOT. Completely civilized when you want it, and a monster when you need it. This is the turbo kit used on the 4 Piston Civic R to produce well over 450whp with 4P DI pump and stock injectors (See dyno chart below). We currently have a bolt-on DI system in development that will produce 550hp with no additional fuel source. Electronic Wastegate Control Designed to be a straightforward bolt-on installation with no permanent modifications required \u2013 each component of this kit was engineered to compliment and retain OEM torque strategies without hacking or compromising the control system that makes this car so good. This may not sound like a big deal on internet forums where dump tubes and external wastegates are the norm \u2013 but electronic internal wastegate actuation is a major component of the FK8\u2019s unique Bosch engine management control system\u2019s logic. We worked extensively with Hondata and MHI (OE Turbo Supplier to Honda) to retain the OEM electronic wastegate control. The FK8 2.0 liter engine\u2019s potential is ready to be unleashed!

Even though the BoostLine rod is designed for heavy duty use, we were able to keep the rod relatively light without compromising strength. Introducing BoostLine Connecting Rods by Wiseco Performance Products! The Wiseco engineering team created this new, patent-pending 3-pocket design specifically for demanding turbocharged, supercharged and big nitrous applications. These connecting rods are ideal for today\u2019s high horsepower engines and provide 60% more bending strength compared to common H-beam rods! Each rod is designed, finished and inspected in the USA and includes an inspection report from our quality team.

The mounting plates can accommodate ITB sizes up to 73.6mm.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis air box was designed by Jackson Myers and offers superior performance over any other box on the market.  A proper air box does much more than direct air to the trumpets. Pressure waves from in and around the bellmouths of the ITB trumpets can produce unpredictable flows within the airbox and drastically affect the performance of each individual cylinder. This air box design takes into consideration the engine configuration and rpm range, and works to maximize performance in this application. It is common to bolt the air box onto a stationary engine without and vehicle movement, and without the use of a fan to facilitate vehicle movement, and to see up to 10 horsepower gains throughout the usable upper rpm range. More performance benefit can be realized in a moving race car at speed.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis air box currently powers ALL of the fastest ALL MOTOR Hondas in the world.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMADE IN THE USA and available exclusively from 4 Piston Racing\u003c\/p\u003e","published_at":"2020-10-27T00:35:35-04:00","created_at":"2020-10-27T00:35:35-04:00","updated_at":"2024-07-15T23:08:43-04:00","vendor":"4 Piston Racing","product_type":"","tags":["Air Intake","BLACK FRIDAY","Honda (K Series)"],"variants":[{"id":34523889369225,"title":"No Extras","option1":"No Extras","option2":null,"option3":null,"sku":"4PCFairbox-1","requires_shipping":true,"taxable":true,"featured_image":null,"available":true,"price":"675.00","grams":18144,"compare_at_price":null,"position":1,"product_id":5236788330633,"created_at":"2020-11-15T16:34:43-05:00","updated_at":"2024-07-15T23:08:43-04:00"},{"id":34523889401993,"title":"Carbon Fiber Velocity Stack","option1":"Carbon Fiber Velocity Stack","option2":null,"option3":null,"sku":"4PCFairbox-2","requires_shipping":true,"taxable":true,"featured_image":null,"available":true,"price":"925.00","grams":4536,"compare_at_price":null,"position":2,"product_id":5236788330633,"created_at":"2020-11-15T16:34:43-05:00","updated_at":"2024-07-15T23:08:43-04:00"}],"images":[{"id":17348725244041,"created_at":"2020-11-15T16:34:35-05:00","position":1,"updated_at":"2020-11-15T16:34:35-05:00","product_id":5236788330633,"variant_ids":[],"src":"https:\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0343\/4800\/7561\/products\/4pairbox1_2.jpg?v=1605476075","width":1000,"height":667},{"id":17348725145737,"created_at":"2020-11-15T16:34:35-05:00","position":2,"updated_at":"2020-11-15T16:34:35-05:00","product_id":5236788330633,"variant_ids":[],"src":"https:\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0343\/4800\/7561\/products\/4pairbox2_1.jpg?v=1605476075","width":1000,"height":667},{"id":17348725211273,"created_at":"2020-11-15T16:34:35-05:00","position":3,"updated_at":"2020-11-15T16:34:35-05:00","product_id":5236788330633,"variant_ids":[],"src":"https:\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0343\/4800\/7561\/products\/4pairbox3_1.jpg?v=1605476075","width":750,"height":1000},{"id":17348725178505,"created_at":"2020-11-15T16:34:35-05:00","position":4,"updated_at":"2020-11-15T16:34:35-05:00","product_id":5236788330633,"variant_ids":[],"src":"https:\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0343\/4800\/7561\/products\/4pairbox4_1.jpg?v=1605476075","width":1000,"height":750}],"options":[{"name":"Options","position":1,"values":["No Extras","Carbon Fiber Velocity Stack"]}]},{"id":5236788297865,"title":"4P Race Oil Pan K20\/K24","handle":"4plean-20915","body_html":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: #ff2a00;\" mce-data-marked=\"1\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIN STOCK\u003c\/strong\u003e\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe 4P Race oil pan is specifically designed to provide superior oiling during hard acceleration on the drag strip, and hard decel during braking and parachute pulls.\u00a0 Its baffling also provides excellent performance in circuit applications.\u00a0 The pan allows for 8 quarts of oil to be run so that you ALWAYS have sufficient oil at the pickup, yet it is far enough away from the crank that you do not suffer windage loss.
