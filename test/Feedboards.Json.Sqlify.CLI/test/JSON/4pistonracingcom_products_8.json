Ultra Series Street Intake Manifolds are manufactured from cast-aluminum high-grade 356 aluminum alloy for lightweight yet added strength over sheet metal manifolds. Each manifold is CNC-machined for a precise fit, and individually inspected for quality assurance. The Ultra Series Street manifold features a generous 74mm throttle body opening and is constructed with thick walls and entry minimizing concerns of breakthrough when port matching. Intense planning and design went into the plenum (1.82L plenum volume) to distribute even airflow to all four cylinders under dynamic load conditions. Placement and design of the velocity stacks were rigorously flow tested to ensure maximum delivery of air to the cylinder. Large velocity stack raised bell mouth entries lead to long 221.5mm intake runners with smooth transitions allowing the Ultra Series Street Intake Manifold to outflow the competition.

Crankshaft","handle":"339-05-0106","body_html":"\u003cp\u003eBeing the \"Godfather's of K\", nobody has more experience with the Honda\/Acura K-Series than Skunk2. Our years pushing the limits of the K-Series continue to make their way into Skunk2's products, allowing racers and enthusiasts the opportunity to enjoy race engineering and technology right off the shelf.\u003c\/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eThis time around Skunk2 has created a lightweight and aero contoured 106mm Billet K Series Crankshaft. Skunk2 Crankshafts are made from the finest grade 4340 steel billet material for unmatched durability. The aerodynamic contoured counter weight design, gun drilled and CNC direct shot oil holes are what sets it apart from the other aftermarket or OEM crankshafts. The aero contoured counter weights design reduces windage and creates less oil resistance which in return produces horse power gains. The Gun Drilling lightens the total weight of the crank and adds strength, the direct shot oil holes create priority oiling all are advantages that impact track performance.

Different manufacturers use their own alloys and design concepts that greatly affect the performance and longevity in your motor. Aluminum rods have advantages and disadvantages alike, depending on the type of racing you are doing. In warmer climates, some people run aluminum in street cars for as long as 50,000 miles. Over the years, aluminum rods have been used in many different types of racing from Top Fuel, Pro Stock, Pro Stock Bike, to endurance and circle track racing. Taking advantage of the aluminum rod benefits depends on the design of the rod and how the motor is assembled and used.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a turbo drag racing application, the rods are lightweight and can act as a shock absorber for the extreme conditions these high hp, high rpm motors can see. For an all motor application, they are lightweight and can help carry more power further in the rpm range than a heavier steel rod. The light weight can also help with crankshaft flexing that occurs in these high rpm applications. 4 Piston works directly with GRP engineers to come up with rods to match your application. We use different blanks for different applications to keep weight down and match the correct rod to your horsepower level. You do not need the same rod for a 400hp all motor engine as you do for a 1000hp turbo engine. We turn our super lightweight all motor rods up to 11,000 rpm every pass. There is no steel rod on the market within 100 grams that will handle this abuse as long as these aluminum rods.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause each application is unique, we build the rods to order.
