This long ratio rod is connected to a strutted ultra lightweight, short-skirt piston with tool steel wrist pin. The piston and ring package are specifically designed for this engine to provide superior ring seal and extended use in abusive conditions. Air and fuel move through this engine via our Pro TSX+ 1 CNC Cylinder Head and 4P RR3 billet camshaft, both that were specifically developed for this 2.0L engine package. We are on the cutting edge of 4 valve cylinder head technology and you will not find similar performance in any other cylinder head. Valve motion is controlled by the highest quality PAC valve spring. Oil pressure and controlled by a 4P CNC Ported oil pump and baffled pan, designed to keep your engine properly lubricated in the most extreme g forces in all directions. When you buy a 4P Endurance Engine you aren't just investing in a top competitor, you are investing in a customer support system and an engine program that you can depend on for multiple race seasons.
