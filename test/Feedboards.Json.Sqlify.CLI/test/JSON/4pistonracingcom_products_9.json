Valve control is one of the most important parts of making power and promoting long engine life. Too often springs are pushed beyond their functional limits and valves bounce out of control. We put these kits together after extensive testing and these are a must if you are racing competitvely, turning high rpm, and running large camshafts. You can spend the money now and have a good spring that maintains valve control and lasts several race seasons, or buy cheap now and replace them a couple times a year...along with the other damage caused by out of control valves. We can also machine the seats to fine tune a pressure setting to suit your specific setup.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e4PR-SPR-1001K - Pro Stock Race Spring\u003c\/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe developed this single spring kit starting with a PSI Pro Stock single spring with Max Life Treatment and our own custom seat and retainer.
