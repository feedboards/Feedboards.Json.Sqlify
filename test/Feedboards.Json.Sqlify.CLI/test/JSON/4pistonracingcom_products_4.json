designed for light weight oil.\u00a0 As the viscosity increases, which is common in high-performance rebuilds (4P engines are spec\u2019d\u00a0for 10W40 or 20w50 oil depending on the application), the

higher than the pressure on the outlet side of the filter, the bypass opens and you get unfiltered oil passing into the engine. \u00a0 This is bad for obvious reasons.\u003c\/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv

with increased RPM).\u00a0 While their filtration spec isn\u2019t quite as good, ~60 micron vs ~ 35 micron, all of your oil is being filtered. \u00a0 60 micron is better than no filtration!\u00a0 The

engine), and in the case of the recommended 51060R WIX Racing filter, there is no bypass, so 100% of the oil is filtered 100% of the time.\u003c\/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv

option.\u00a0 The higher than average bypass setting of 15psi, and increased surface area, will result in little if any bypass as long as the filter is in good condition, as flow will reduce as the filter gains contaminants stored.\u003c\/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"gmail_default\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c\/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"gmail_default\"\u003eThe GT1R Oil Filter adaptor includes

cylinder head for your K24Z powered street or race car.\u00a0 This platform has long been neglected due to a lack of camshaft and valvetrain availability, and the single port exhaust design that has been touted as an Achilles heel when compared to traditional 4 port K20 cylinder heads.\u00a0 It is true that this presents some challenges when building a maximum output high rpm platform, but it also presents some great opportunities.\u00a0 The intake port from the factory stock R40 is actually the best flowing K-Series port that Honda has produced to date,\u00a0and we drastically improve on that.\u00a0\u00a0The exhaust\u00a0may appear to be a challenge, but it can be exploited as a great opportunity for many users.\u00a0 This head design makes turbo packaging much easier, and reasonably sized turbos in the 500-850whp range respond and spool very fast.\u00a0 This R40 cylinder head arrangement is also preferred in some RWD applications for its superior packaging.\u00a0 You may be a person that doesn't want to tackle the challenges of swapping to a 4 port head, and this CNC Cylinder head lays the ground work for you to make more power than you can ever use effectively.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe take the R40 Cylinder Head casting and CNC port the intake ports and critical bottleneck areas of the exhaust port.\u00a0 This includes the bowls and short turns, and a major rework of the exhaust outlet.\u00a0 Areas of the port that are close to water jackets are left alone to prevent cracking with high exhaust temperatures and big boost loads.\u00a0 Once the head is CNC ported, we finish it off with a fresh surface and our Newen single point CNC valve job.\u00a0 We also offer our own PAC valve spring setup that is far superior in valve control and longevity than preexisting offerings.\u00a0 4P Camshafts are in production, with delivery expected late 2021.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eSend your R40 head casting for us to port,

The BoostLine connecting rods is a scratch design that takes the best attributes of an H- and I-beam rod and merges them into one. Even though the BoostLine rod is designed for heavy duty use, we were able to keep the rod relatively light without compromising strength. Introducing BoostLine Connecting Rods by Wiseco Performance Products! The Wiseco engineering team created this new, patent-pending 3-pocket design specifically for demanding turbocharged, supercharged and big nitrous applications. These connecting rods are ideal for today\u2019s high horsepower engines and provide 60% more bending strength compared to common H-beam rods! Each rod is designed, finished and inspected in the USA and includes an inspection report from our quality team.

If you want to advance 2 degrees, move the gear 2 on the face, slide the pin in, and it will move exactly 2 degrees. Not only does this save you time during the cam degree process, you can also offer your customers different settings for their cam centerlines with simple instructions to move to a specific pin location, slide the alignment pin in, and tighten the gears down.
