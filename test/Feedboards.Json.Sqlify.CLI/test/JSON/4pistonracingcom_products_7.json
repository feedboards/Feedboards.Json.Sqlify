of the class in any racing series. This engine is a \"no-compromises\" approach using the highest quality components available, starting with a rigid RR ductile iron sleeve and our durable 340 gram aluminum rod. This is connected to a strutted ultra lightweight 16:1 compression 260 gram piston with tool steel wrist pin. The piston and ring package are specifically designed for this engine to provide superior ring seal for maximum compression. Air and fuel move through this engine via our 425+ CFM CNC Cylinder Head and Skunk2 BMFx billet camshaft. We are on the cutting edge of 4 valve cylinder head technology and you will not find similar performance in any other cylinder head. Our unique design allows these engines to peak and carry beyond 10,000 rpm, all while retaining the bottom end for excellent acceleration through the early part of the track. The super alloy valves are controlled by the infamous 4P PSI Pro Stock valve spring. This spring produces high rpm power that is lost in other valve springs, and helps to protect your engine in the event of a missed gear. On a Dynojet through a FWD transmission, this engine will produce 420-460whp depending on the fuel used. When you buy a 4P Drag Race engine you aren't just investing in a top competitor, you are investing in a customer support system and an engine program that you can depend on for multiple race seasons.

This engine is a \"no-compromises\" approach using the highest quality components available, starting with a rigid\u00a04P ductile iron sleeve and our durable 340 gram aluminum rod. This is connected to a strutted ultra lightweight 15:1+ compression 260 gram piston with tool steel wrist pin. The piston and ring package are specifically designed for this engine to provide superior ring seal for maximum compression. Air and fuel move through this engine via our latest 410+ CFM \"Peacemake Jr\" CNC Cylinder Head and exclusive Skunk2 BMFx billet camshaft. We are on the cutting edge of 4 valve cylinder head technology and you will not find similar performance in any other cylinder head. Our unique design allows these engines to peak and carry beyond 11,000 rpm, all while retaining the bottom end for excellent acceleration through the early part of the track. The super alloy valves are controlled by the infamous 4P PSI Pro Stock valve spring.\u00a0 This spring produces high rpm power that is lost in other valve springs, and helps to protect your engine in the event of a missed gear.\u00a0 On a Dynojet through a FWD transmission, this engine will exceed 400whp on VP M1, and much more on fuels with additives. When you buy a 4P Drag Race engine you aren't just investing in a top competitor, you are investing in a customer support system and an engine program that you can depend on for multiple race seasons. \u00a0Email Luke@team4piston.com for a shipping quote. \u00a0We ship worldwide.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e4P\u00a0rigid ductile iron sleeve Honda K20 or K24 engine block 99mm stroke x 90mm bore\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e4P GRP aluminum 340 gram pro stock connecting rod\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e4P Wiseco strutted box forged ultra lightweight piston, 90mm, 15:1 compression\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eACL race bearings, ARP fasteners, exclusive 4P spec head gasket for better seal\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e4P\u00a0Peacemaker Jr. CNC race cylinder head, 4P custom valves, 4P PSI Pro Stock valve springs, Ferrea locks (Updated in 2022)\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSkunk2 BMFx Camshaft\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e4P Ported oil pump and baffled sump\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAll new Honda timing components and hardware\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eComplete engine valve cover to oil pan\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMeticulously assembled and supplied with detailed build sheets\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eProven 9 second 400+whp stock stroke power over and over\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003c\/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: medium;\"\u003eRecommended Use\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/strong\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: small;\"\u003eDrag Race\u003cbr\u003e\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDedicated Grudge Race \/ Street Race\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: small;\"\u003eRace fuel required\u003cbr\u003e\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003c\/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: medium;\"\u003eFeatures and Benefits\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/strong\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: small;\"\u003eLightweight components that are designed to last\u003cbr\u003e\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e4P\u00a0Peacemaker Jr. CNC Cylinder Head with the latest in 4 valve cylinder head technology\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePremium 4P PSI Pro Stock Valve Springs produce high rpm power and protect your engine in the event of a missed gear\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e4P Oil Pump provides superior oiling at high rpm\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eCleanliness and attention to detail that everyone will be proud to own\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMeticulously Assembled - Supplied with full engine specifications and tolerances\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eRecommend periodic maintenance procedures\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003c\/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen you purchase a 4 Piston Racing complete engine, you aren't just buying any run-of-the-mill engine package.

The high flow CNC cylinder head and high lift camshaft allow this engine to accelerate its 340hp aggressively beyond 9000 rpm. Lean into the throttle on an open road and the power and sound experience is liberating. All this with the peace of mind that you are commanding a durable and reliable engine. \u00a0Power level is quoted based on pump gasoline and popular street induction and header. \u00a0Race pieces will increase output. \u00a0Email Luke@team4piston.com for a shipping quote. \u00a0We ship worldwide.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eStock cylinder sleeve Honda K24 engine block 99mm stroke x 87.5mm bore\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSaenz S-Series connecting rod\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWiseco Armor Plated 12.5:1 piston\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eACL race bearings, ARP fasteners, 4P spec head gasket\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e4P Pro 156v2 CNC Cylinder Head with Ferrea valves, valve springs, retainers, and locks\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e4P tool steel billet RR4 iVTEC camshafts\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e4P Ported oil pump and baffled sump\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAll new Honda timing components and hardware\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eComplete engine valve cover to oil pan\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMeticulously assembled and supplied with detailed build sheets.\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003c\/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: medium;\"\u003eRecommended Use\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/strong\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: small;\"\u003eDaily Street Use\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAuto X\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTrack Use\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: small;\"\u003eMinimum 91 Octane Pump Gas \/ E85 \/ Race Fuel\u003cbr\u003e\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003c\/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: medium;\"\u003eFeatures and Benefits\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/strong\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eArmor Plated Forged Pistons and Forged Connecting Rods\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePremium Valvetrain Components for Extended Durability\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePrecision Machined CNC Cylinder Head Designed for use throughout the powerband\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMeticulously Assembled - Supplied with full engine specifications and tolerances\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eRecommend periodic maintenance procedures\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003c\/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen you purchase a 4 Piston Racing complete engine, you aren't just buying any run-of-the-mill engine package.
