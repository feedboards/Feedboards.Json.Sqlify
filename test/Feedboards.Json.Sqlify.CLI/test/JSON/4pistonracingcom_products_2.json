Type R, Accord, or Integra has been carefully developed after years of on-track development in 4P K20C1 racing engines.\u00a0 Engines for racing applications are built with different tolerances and operated at high temperature under full load.\u00a0 RPM\u00a0capabilities are increased dramatically in 4P race engines and the need for a better performing oil system is critical.\u00a0 These changes in the operating environment and how the engines are assembled require the oil pump to flow much better than OEM to maintain the pressures required to protect your engine.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe 4P oil pump increases the flow rate by more than 10% and eliminates cavitation and aeration in your oil as you begin to increase your engine speed beyond 8000

protect your multi-thousand dollar investment.\u00a0 You can depend on the 4P name and our relentless pursuit to produce the world's best engines.\u00a0 We bring decades of experience in perfecting Honda oiling systems as seen with our world renowned K20 and B-Series oil systems that have allowed racers to maintain oil pressure to beyond 12,000 rpm without cavitation and while maintaining constant pressure through the entire RPM range.\u00a0 That same expertise has been applied to our K20C1 Ported High Flow pump in our racing engines since their release and is now available to

Race Head\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis cylinder head is specifically designed to take the extreme abuse of ultra-high horsepower applications.\u00a0 As SFWD, AWD, and Pro RWD cars begin to exceed 1500whp, 1800hp, and even 2000+hp, the OEM head castings become a failure point, often splitting in half or cracking through the deck and port walls.\u00a0 The 4P Kingpin uses the 4P Race Casting which features a deck that is 3x thicker than any OEM casting, and port walls that are MUCH thicker than stock.\u00a0 These heads have been proven on race cars running over 100psi of boost that were splitting heads in half nearly every pass.\u00a0 These simply will not suffer the same fate.\u00a0 That thicker deck and casting provides superior head gasket sealing and improves power by keeping things rigid and from moving around.\u00a0 These castings are made in the USA using premium materials, then we put them through a special process that removes porosity to make these solid like a\u00a0piece of billet.\u00a0 While your competition is running stock ports to try to hold them together, step up to the 4P Kingpin and give your race program a serious power and reliability advantage.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: #ff2a00;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAs seen on the Worlds Fastest 4 Cylinder \"No War\" 5.86@244

To manufacture the valves we use our exclusive two-step slow-forging process applied to the special alloys selected to suit intake and exhaust applications. We provide a unique heat-treatment and stress-relieving process, along with hard chrome stems and friction-welded hard tips. We finish the valves with a swirl-polished head.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFerrea Valves feature flow improvements to deliver the power needed for today\u2019s sophisticated Sport Compact racing engines.\u003c\/p\u003e","published_at":"2022-02-19T11:12:08-05:00","created_at":"2022-02-19T11:10:54-05:00","updated_at":"2024-07-15T23:07:42-04:00","vendor":"4 Piston Racing","product_type":"","tags":["Honda (K Series)","K24Z R40","K24Z7","R40","Valve (Exhaust)","Valve (Intake)"],"variants":[{"id":40009191686281,"title":"36mm Intake","option1":"36mm Intake","option2":null,"option3":null,"sku":"F6074","requires_shipping":true,"taxable":true,"featured_image":null,"available":true,"price":"152.00","grams":2268,"compare_at_price":null,"position":1,"product_id":6809525715081,"created_at":"2022-02-19T11:10:54-05:00","updated_at":"2024-07-15T23:07:42-04:00"},{"id":40009191751817,"title":"31mm Exhaust","option1":"31mm Exhaust","option2":null,"option3":null,"sku":"F6072","requires_shipping":true,"taxable":true,"featured_image":null,"available":true,"price":"152.00","grams":2268,"compare_at_price":null,"position":3,"product_id":6809525715081,"created_at":"2022-02-19T11:10:54-05:00","updated_at":"2024-07-15T23:07:42-04:00"}],"images":[{"id":29063402946697,"created_at":"2022-02-19T11:10:56-05:00","position":1,"updated_at":"2022-02-19T11:10:56-05:00","product_id":6809525715081,"variant_ids":[],"src":"https:\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0343\/4800\/7561\/products\/ferrea6000valves_2_3_af01db8a-38e2-4eca-8d08-781a52969d61.jpg?v=1645287056","width":801,"height":534}],"options":[{"name":"Select Valves","position":1,"values":["36mm Intake","31mm Exhaust"]}]}]}
